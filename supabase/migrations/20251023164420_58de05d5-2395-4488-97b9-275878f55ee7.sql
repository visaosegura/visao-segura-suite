-- Add RLS policies for user_roles table

-- Users can view their own roles
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own roles"
  ON public.user_roles FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Admins can view all roles
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all roles"

-- Only the trigger function can insert roles (via SECURITY DEFINER)
-- No direct INSERT policy needed as this is handled by the handle_new_user function
